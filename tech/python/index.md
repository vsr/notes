# Python

## Python 2 or 3?

Use homebrew to install Python so that you have `python3` and `python2` commands. https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-and-Python#python-3x-or-python-2x

To work on a Python 3 project, create a virtual environment and activate it:

```sh
python3 -m venv ./env
source ./env/bin/activate
```

## [Pip](pip.md)
